# Round-Robin-scheduling
ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
We consider another array to keep track of burst time.
time quantum=3
| p1  | p2  | p3  | p4  | p1  | p2  | p3  | p1  | 
0     3     6     9     12    15    16    18    22

turn around time=completion time-arrival time
waiting time=turn around time-burst time
